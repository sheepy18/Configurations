1. Clear the bench, clear your mind. => Buy only the units you need/you want to play.
2. Buy the first chosen. => You get a guaranteed 2 Star unit.
3. Always craft items if u  have 4 or more single materials. => Every item helps to save HP and get a stronger board.
4. Randomise your positionning. => Fake swap: split team in 2 halfs on 2 sides of the board and move one half to the another randomly.
5. Force Compositions. => Go for 2-3 compositions you want to play. If you know what you play and search for, can save a lot of time and use it elsewhere like positioning.
6. If you are below 20 HP use all of your gold and items/neekos on your bench. => Below 20 hP is the point that you want to protect with all resources you have
7. Don't go below 10/20 gold if you do a big roll during the midgame. => If you roll to 0 gold, it is very hard to get back a good working economy.
8. Roll if you have 3 or more pairs. => it will strenghtening your board and brings the unused/useless gold from your bench on your board.
9. Use the strongest board at all times. => It will gives you a winning streak and save HP for the lategame.
